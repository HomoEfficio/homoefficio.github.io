# For users, if you only use this theme, put your images directly in `source/assets/images` folder
# For developpers, if you modify this theme, put your images in `source/_images` folder and
# use grunt task `build` to synchronize assets

# Image directory (default: images)
image_dir: assets/images

# Sidebar Configuration
#    You can add groups of links and links much as you want
#    You just have to respect the indentation : `groups of links` -> `link` -> `title, link, icon`
#    E.g :
#    -------------
#       sidebar:                   # DON'T modify this variable name
#            menu:                 # Name of your groups of links (changeable)
#                home:             # Name of your link (changeable)
#                   title: Home    # Title of your link displayed
#                   url: /         # URL of the link. If the URL is internal, domain name is not necessary
#                   icon: home     # Name of the font awesome icon class without the `fa-`
#                                  # Go to http://fontawesome.io/icons/ to find class name of icon
